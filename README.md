🚀 Just Built an AI-Powered Cold Email Generator with LLMs! ✉️🤖
Excited to share a recent project I worked on using LLMs + Streamlit + LangChain!
🔍 What it does:
 The app takes a job posting URL (e.g., Meta careers page) and auto-generates a personalized cold email for the user — tailored to the job's skills, experience, and responsibilities.
⚙️ How it works:
Users paste a job link.
The app scrapes the page content, cleans it, and then…
Uses LLM (LLaMA3 via Groq) to extract key details like role, skills, description, and experience.
Finally, it crafts a customized email, even embedding a link to your LinkedIn profile!
🛠️ Built using:
 Streamlit, LangChain, Python, Regex, and Groq API (LLaMA3)
💡 Why this matters:
 Writing cold emails that stand out is hard. This project automates the process, making it faster, smarter, and more relevant for every opportunity.
